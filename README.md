Our project aims to use machine learning and user friendly displays to display our calculated forecasts of changes in weather metrics over varying periods of time. The primary focus of our project is to communicate the impacts of the climate change crisis through the visualization of trends in weather data. With the increase in concern and occurrence of climate related disasters, the need for an increased awareness has become more critical in order to empower communities to prepare for the impending shifts in our climate. By creating a React based web application that displays the charted change in weather metrics over time, we hope that the interactivity, simple design, and simple but powerful visuals will thoroughly educate our users of the scale of the climate crisis.
